tree-sitter-php-abc
==================

This is a thin fork of [tree-sitter-php](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-php) providing **A**tom **B**ackwards **C**ompatibility. At the time of this writing (Sept '21), Atom only supports tree-sitter 0.17, but tree-sitter-php is released against 0.19+. This just rebuilds it against tree-sitter 0.17 so that it can be used in Atom, and specifically in [language-php](https://github.com/atom/lnguge-php)
